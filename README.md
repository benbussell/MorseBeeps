# MorseBeeps
This C# project converts user inputted alpanumeric text to Morse code, then offers an option of audio beep playback. The user can also select to randomly generate a phrase from a list of 3000 popular literary quotes.  Whether the user chooses to type their own phrase or choose to have one randomly selected, they will be given the option to save the selection to a list of favorites.  The user can view the list of favorites from the main menu, and select phrases from the list to translate, playback with beeps, or remove from the list.
